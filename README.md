Tachyus Assignment by Mateo Acosta (Petroleum Engineer)
Methane Emissions Dashboard

The assignment contains a dashboard featuring three figures with a year scroll bar and a basin selector.
The idea is that the dashboard itself should be easy to view, not having to scroll up/down.
The proyect itself was made with that into consideration, so the way to view it is as shown in the video, within an explorer (I used Firefox for example).

The proyect contains a AssignmentTachyus.ipynb as it was made with Jupyter Notebook.
To view it as I showcased it, one must use CMD to the folder which the proyect is located to obtain the address. I ended up using port 8080.

The assumptions I made was to fit everything on a screen easy to view, I distributed them horizontally side-by-side.
The graphs themselves are interactive, using plotly.express. They can be clicked on/off as shown in the video.
I also abbreviated the names on figure 2, particularly the Company Names since they were extensive.
